# Feature Engineering Using Pandas

This project focuses on feature engineering using Python and Pandas.  
The notebook demonstrates how raw tabular data can be transformed into meaningful features that are useful for machine learning models.

## What this project does
- Loads a dataset using Pandas
- Creates new features from existing columns
- Extracts information from timestamps
- Converts raw data into structured numerical features

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features Implemented
- Episode count feature creation
- Timestamp-based feature extraction
- Month extraction from timestamp values
- Data transformation for ML readiness

## Why feature engineering matters
Feature engineering improves model performance by:
- Providing meaningful signals to ML algorithms
- Reducing noise in raw data
- Making patterns easier to learn

Most real-world ML performance gains come from **better features**, not complex models.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
